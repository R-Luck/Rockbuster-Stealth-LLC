Here is an SQL query, using a CTE, to find the average amount spent by the top 5 Rockbuster customers in the top 10 cities.

WITH top_five_customers_cte (amount,customer_id,first_name,last_name,city,country) AS

(SELECT A.amount,
        B.customer_id,
        B.first_name,
        B.last_name,
        D.city,
        E.country,
 SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
 FROM payment A
 INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
 INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
 INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
 INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
 WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
 GROUP BY A.amount,
         B.customer_id,
         B.first_name,
         B.last_name,
         D.city,
         E.country
 ORDER BY (total_amount_paid) DESC
 LIMIT 5) 
 
 SELECT AVG (total_amount_paid)
 FROM top_five_customers_cte
