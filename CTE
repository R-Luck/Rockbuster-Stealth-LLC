Here is an SQL query, using a CTE, to find the count of films in each category when looked at by rating.

WITH category_name_cte (film_id, rating, category_name) AS
  (SELECT A.film_id,
          A.rating,
          C.name
   FROM film A
   LEFT JOIN film_category B ON A.film_id = B.film_id
   LEFT JOIN category C ON B.category_id = C.category_id)
SELECT rating,
       category_name,
       COUNT (film_id) AS counts
FROM category_name_cte
GROUP BY rating,
         category_name
ORDER BY rating,
         counts DESC
