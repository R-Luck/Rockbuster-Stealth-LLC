Here is an SQL query, using a SUBQUERY, to find out how many of Rockbusters top 5 customers are based in which country.

SELECT E.country,
COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT (DISTINCT top_five_customers.customer_id) AS top_five_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
LEFT JOIN

(SELECT A.amount,
B.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country,
SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.amount,
B.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country
ORDER BY (total_amount_paid) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_five_customers

ON E.country = top_five_customers.country
GROUP BY E.country
ORDER BY top_five_customers DESC
LIMIT 10
