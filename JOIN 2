Here is an SQL query, using a JOIN, to find the sales count by film category

SELECT E.name,
       COUNT (amount) AS transactions_per_category
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film_category D ON C.film_id = D.film_id
INNER JOIN category E ON D.category_id = E.category_id
GROUP BY E.name
ORDER BY transactions_per_category DESC
