Here is an SQL query, using a JOIN, to find the number of Rockbuster customers in each country and how much they spend.

SELECT D.country,
       COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS customer_count,
       SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY country
